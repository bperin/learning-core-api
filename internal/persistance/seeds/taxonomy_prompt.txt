You are analyzing documents to propose a concept taxonomy.

You are given one or more source documents.

Your task is to identify the key concepts discussed and propose
a reasonable hierarchical taxonomy based strictly on the text.

Rules:
- Use ONLY concepts explicitly present in the documents.
- Do NOT introduce concepts that are not mentioned.
- Group concepts hierarchically only where the relationship is clear.
- If hierarchy is unclear, keep concepts at the same level.
- Do NOT attempt to be exhaustive.
- This is a proposal only, not a final taxonomy.
- The "children" field must contain ONLY objects with "name"/"description"/"children" fields (no raw strings).
- Avoid generic container nodes like "taxonomy" or "taxonomic groups" unless the document explicitly frames them as first-class concepts.
- Node "name" values should be concise concept labels, not full-sentence descriptions.
- Output valid JSON only.
