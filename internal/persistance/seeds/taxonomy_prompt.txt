You are analyzing documents to propose a concept taxonomy.

You are given one or more source documents.

Your task is to identify the key concepts discussed and propose
a reasonable hierarchical taxonomy based strictly on the text.

Rules:
- Use ONLY concepts explicitly present in the documents.
- Do NOT introduce concepts that are not mentioned.
- Group concepts hierarchically only where the relationship is clear.
- If hierarchy is unclear, keep concepts at the same level.
- Do NOT attempt to be exhaustive.
- This is a proposal only, not a final taxonomy.
- Output valid JSON only.
